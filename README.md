1. Project Concept and Purpose
Purpose
They are targeted towards individuals multitasking in their daily routine - Students, Office Workers, and Parents looking to organize their schedules.

Log in 5 of your main tasks daily to give you an overview of all tasks and check them out when they are completed so that you can keep track of the progress during the day.

It implements a reward system where you get a streak at the end of the day if you complete all tasks
Main Feature
At the end of the day, it will calculate the percentage of checked tasks within the list and return a message like “Well done! You have completed 75% of your tasks so you do not win a streak.”

A streak in the to-do list is a feature where it’s won by completing all your tasks. 

Usually, everyone will try to win subconsciously so by implementing a reward system in a to-do list, an individual will most likely be keen on completing all tasks to get their streaks.
The streak is stored and displayed on top of the lists

User Experience
Header will have a “Hello” message followed by streaks number
Next Section - a form of 5 input fields for all tasks - besides each tasks is a checkbox which user can click when tasks are completed
